# Vehicle Sales Analysis of Telangana


## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive and insightful dashboard using Power BI for analyzing vehicle sales data obtained from the Regional Transport Authority of Telangana. The dashboard enables stakeholders to understand various trends, distributions, and growth metrics related to vehicle sales across different categories, regions, and years.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Model_Desc**: Model Description of the vehicle
- **Fuel**: Fuel Type
- **V_Vhc_ClsID**: Vehicle Classification
- **Make_Yr**: Vehicle Make Year
- **SeatingCapacity**: Seating Capacity of the vehicle
- **IncValidTo**: Validity Date of Insurance
- **SecondVehicle**: Indicator if it is the second vehicle of the owner
- **C_Transport**: Indicator if the vehicle is Transport or Non-Transport
- **Manufacturer_Name**: Name of the Automobile Company
- **Apprved_Dt**: Date of Approval
- **OfficeCd**: Registration Office Name
- **fromdate**: Date of Sale/Registration

## Objectives
1. **Analyze Yearly Sales Trends**: Understand how vehicle sales have changed over the years.
2. **Identify Top Performing Regions**: Pinpoint regions with the highest vehicle sales for potential business expansion.
3. **Evaluate Vehicle Categories**: Compare sales distribution across different vehicle categories (Transport vs. Non-Transport).
4. **Monitor Second Vehicle Ownership**: Analyze trends in second vehicle ownership.
5. **Calculate Growth Rates**: Determine the year-on-year growth rates in vehicle sales.

## Challenges
This project is one of my unguided projects involving a big dataset with around 48 Csv files resulting in 52 lakh rows of dataset. Handling such a large amount of data was really challenging, so I combined the data and performed data cleaning and manipulation in Power Query. This process ensured the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis, which was crucial for generating meaningful insights and creating effective visualizations.

## Skills Utilized

- Power BI
- Power Query Editor
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Data Visualization
- Interactive Dashboard Design
